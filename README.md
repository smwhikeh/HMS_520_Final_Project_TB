# HMS_520_Final_Project_TB
Final Project for HMS520 Data Analysis for (GBD 2021) Tuberculosis Estimates 1990-2021

## Team member[s]

- Sophie Whikehart and Ye Naing 

## Format we chose 

- 3. Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R

## Overall goal of project 

In our project we plan to use the Global Burden of Disease 2021 (GBD 2021) Tuberculosis Estimates 1990-2021. 
Our dataset contains mortality counts across different age groups, years and location. We would like to investigate trends in global mortality rates from tuberculosis by different 
age groups and regions from 2015 and 2020 in order to understand patterns in mortality rates. Our main questions are:

1. How have mortality trends changed from 2015 and 2020 across different age groups?

2. Whigh regions have seen the largest change in mortality rates over time and how do these trends compare across age groups?

3. Are there specific age groups or regions that consistently experience higher mortality rates compared to the global avergae?
